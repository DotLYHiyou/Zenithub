<h1>Disclaimer to students using Zenithub!</h1>
<p>DotLYHiyou and T9 are not responsible for any trouble using our services can get you into.</p>
<p>The choice you made to play games in the middle of class (or any other situation where using our services is inappropriate) is simply a self-concious decision. Dot might even clown you if he finds out lol.</p>
<h1>Disclaimer to Teachers who caught their students using Zenithub</h1>
<p>Your best approach is to punish the student by confiscating their device for a while, talking to their parents, and preferably blocking this site.</p>
<p>Do i not want the site getting blocked in your area because of loss of users? Maybe. Do I make revenue from Zenithub? No. This is a passion project, so it won't make much of a difference anyway.</p>
